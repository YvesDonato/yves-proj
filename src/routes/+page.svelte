		Hello, My name is Yves Donato, I'm a software developer, researcher, and a 3rd year Computer Science student studying at Sheridan College. <br> <br> 
    I have had a passion for Computer Science since a young age with my first <b>two internships</b> being when I was 16 in High School. Graduated High 
    School with a major in Computer Science (SHSM). Moved on to Sheridan College where I finished my diploma in <b>Computer Programming in 2023.</b> 
    I went on to continue my education with the Computer Science bachelor's program at Sheridan where I recently defended my <b>thesis on Large Language Models</b> and gained permission from the faculty to publish my research.</p>
