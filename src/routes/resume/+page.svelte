      Dear Recruiter, <br><br>
      I want to formally thank you for taking your time to both examine my resume and website. I know there are plenty of exceptional applicants who have applied to your company, so taking your time to click on the link on my resume means the world to me, even if you were just checking if I was lying about having a website.
      <br><br>
      I’m sure that you were expecting a letter explaining how fantastic I am and how I know everything about computer science and IT, but this is not true; virtually no one at the CO-OP/Intern stage of their professional experience does. I suppose that's the point of internships: to form students into the most capable engineers. What I can say for sure is that in the small sections of computer science I have chosen to specialize in, I have a depth of knowledge that many other applicants do not possess. I hope that I can prove to you that this is the case.
      <br><br>
      One more point and I’ll end my spiel. I truly love computer science;
      I love building systems and infrastructure, even if no one will ever
      see them. I’ve cut a ton of personal projects from my resume; this
      website is technically one of them, in the sense that I never wrote
      about it. Every summer since I learned to code was filled with coding
      projects. I have so many projects that I no longer remember them,
      just the feeling that I’ve done something similar. I code so much I no
      longer even think of it as work; it's just a way of life for me. In my
      case, it literally has to be; every time I want to add a program to my computer,
      I have to hard-code it into my system; that's how <a href="https://nixos.org/"><u>NixOS</u></a> works.
      <br><br>
      Spiel over, thank you for reading this and examining both my resume and website.
      <br><br>
      Best Regards,
      <br>
      Yves Donato
